First, I will describe a feature to Claude Code. Claude Code will do the following
- create a new issue with gh issue create
- develop to create a branch for the issue, don't checkout new branch yet
- create a new subtree for the feature nested within the root of the current code repo using newly created branch 
- change into the new subdirectory

No need for an author the new issue. Pick a concise name for the branch, try to keep the total number of letters small, Dont use spaces or uppercase letters.
